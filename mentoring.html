            <h3>Because learning alone is boring</h2>
            <p>Part of a <a href="http://mentoring.is/">distributed mentoring movement</a>.

        <p>
        Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and
        encouraged by the mentors I've been fortunate enough to have. I believe
        that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal
        relationships, and it's important to me to make myself available as a
        mentor to others.</p>

        <p>
        I've had so many great experiences in my life, and I'd love to share
        them if you're considering pursuing a similar path.</p>

        <li> "Accomplished" guitar player of 11 years. </li>
        <li> Working on an Undergraduate degree in Computer Scienece at the
        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
        <li> Working at Microsoft Corporation - Summer 2012 on Windows core
        team. I will be working on the windows server - specifically Hyper-V as a
        software development engineer in test.

        <p>
        If you'd like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions
        below; I'll write back to all letters I receive in this way within
        1 week no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters,
        I'll propose further correspondence-and in certain cases, an ongoing
        mentoring relationship.</p>

        <li>Tell me about yourself.
        <li>How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?
        <li>What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
        <li>What's the best thing you've read, watched, or listened to lately?

        <p>Add links to any profiles or projects you're proud of, and
        send it all to: <a
            href="mailto:ddcross2@illinois.edu">drew@ddcross.com</a>.</p>

        <p>
        I look forward to learning together!</p>
